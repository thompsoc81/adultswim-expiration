# [adultswim] Expiration Notices
This [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) script adds expiration dates to most of the videos posted to [adultswim.com](https://adultswim.com).

While the [adultswim] website often shows the expiration dates on individual episode description pages, it does not display them on thumbnails such as those found on the overall show listing pages.  Regardless, this metadata is usually include in the page DOM, anyway.  This script simply looks for these hidden timestamps and adds a tag above the episode title.
